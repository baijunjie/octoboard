 * method's direct `insertText` commit while it is set. With a CJK input method, WebKit delivers the
 * commit for a shifted full-width mark (`？` is Shift+/) *before* the mark's own keydown, so the
 * `Shift` keydown has already armed the flag and the first press is swallowed.
 *
 * xterm writes the flag before it calls the custom key handler, and clears it before it calls it on
 * keyup, so the observer can tell what the flag held before a modifier keydown and put that back.
 * It is restored rather than cleared: while another key is still down, that key's commit may still
 * be pending through xterm's own deferred path, and letting the `input` event through as well
 * would send it twice.
 *
 * It must run from the terminal's one custom key handler, since xterm accepts only one, and first
 * in it, ahead of any early return, so that it sees every keydown and keyup. It reaches into a
 * private field, so recheck it on every `@xterm/xterm` upgrade.
 *
 * TODO: remove once `@xterm/xterm` stops arming `_keyDownSeen` on a modifier-only keydown.
