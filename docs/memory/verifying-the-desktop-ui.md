# Verifying behaviour in the desktop app

## Launch the real window for any change on the startup or mount path

A webview that throws while mounting is a blank window — no message anywhere, and neither `tsc` nor a reviewer reading
the diff can see it; three review rounds here passed on code whose window never rendered once. So whenever a change
touches startup, the daemon-sidecar handover or the terminal's mount, run the app and capture the window, then confirm
the whole chain positively: the window paints, the sidecar starts, the webview connects, the menu fills, a selected
session's terminal renders. Capturing the window needs no Accessibility permission of its own, so this check is
always available and costs about a minute.

## Get a diagnosis out of a blank window by rendering it into the DOM

The window's own pixels are the only readable output channel: devtools can only be opened by the keystroke injection
that needs Accessibility permission, and the native window title is set by the Rust shell and does not follow
`document.title`. So install a `window.onerror` / `unhandledrejection` handler that writes the error and its stack
straight into the document body, and read it off a screenshot. The React error boundary does not remove the need for
this — it catches render-time throws only, while a throw from a library's own scheduled work, or from module-level
code running before React mounts, still leaves a silent blank window.

## Bisect every terminal symptom against the daemon before blaming the agent

When the app shows a terminal symptom — a keystroke doing nothing, input dying after a session switch, a pane looking
stale — send the same bytes straight to the daemon's terminal WebSocket and compare before concluding anything. On
screen a UI defect and ordinary agent behaviour are indistinguishable: "Ctrl+C is being swallowed above the terminal",
"the UI rebound the read path on a session switch but not the write path" and "this agent simply ignores Esc in this
state" all look exactly alike, and only the side-by-side comparison tells them apart. Do this before filing a symptom
against an agent or against `xterm.js`.

## A scripted GUI probe can only confirm a positive, never a negative

A key combination that fails to arrive may be the probe's fault rather than the app's: through `osascript` / System
Events, `keystroke "<letter>" using control down` can be dropped silently where the same combination sent as
`key code <n> using control down` arrives. Prefer `key code`, and never conclude "the app swallows this key" from a
scripted probe without confirming by hand.

Two further limits on macOS: driving the real app this way requires Accessibility permission granted to the host
application of whatever runs the script, and native `<select>` popups cannot be driven through the accessibility tree
at all — to make a control scriptable, build it from something other than a native `<select>`, or drive it by hand.

## Input-method checks have to be done by a person

Injected keystrokes bypass macOS input methods entirely, so a scripted CJK composition test passes without ever
exercising the IME and proves nothing. Ask the user to type it and report what they saw.
