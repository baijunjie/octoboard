# Verifying behaviour in the desktop app

## Bisect every terminal symptom against the daemon before blaming the agent

When the app shows a terminal symptom — a keystroke doing nothing, input dying after a session switch, a pane looking
stale — send the same bytes straight to the daemon's terminal WebSocket and compare before concluding anything. On
screen a UI defect and ordinary agent behaviour are indistinguishable: "Ctrl+C is being swallowed above the terminal",
"the UI rebound the read path on a session switch but not the write path" and "this agent simply ignores Esc in this
state" all look exactly alike, and only the side-by-side comparison tells them apart. Do this before filing a symptom
against an agent or against `xterm.js`.

## A scripted GUI probe can only confirm a positive, never a negative

A key combination that fails to arrive may be the probe's fault rather than the app's: through `osascript` / System
Events, `keystroke "<letter>" using control down` can be dropped silently where the same combination sent as
`key code <n> using control down` arrives. Prefer `key code`, and never conclude "the app swallows this key" from a
scripted probe without confirming by hand.

Two further limits on macOS: driving the real app this way requires Accessibility permission granted to the host
application of whatever runs the script, and native `<select>` popups cannot be driven through the accessibility tree
at all — to make a control scriptable, build it from something other than a native `<select>`, or drive it by hand.

## Input-method checks have to be done by a person

Injected keystrokes bypass macOS input methods entirely, so a scripted CJK composition test passes without ever
exercising the IME and proves nothing. Ask the user to type it and report what they saw.
